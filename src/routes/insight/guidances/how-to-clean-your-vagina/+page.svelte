		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			To clean your vagina properly, it's essential to understand its anatomy. The vagina is the
			internal canal leading to the cervix, while the vulva refers to the external genitalia.

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Gentle External Cleansing</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Cleaning the external genitalia, known as the vulva, is the primary focus of vaginal hygiene.
			Follow these steps for gentle and effective external cleansing:

		<ol class="font-sans text-lg list-decimal list-inside mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			<li>
				<strong>Use Warm Water:</strong> Opt for warm water rather than harsh soaps or fragrant products. Plain water
				is usually sufficient to cleanse the vulva and remove any sweat, debris, or menstrual blood.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Mild, pH-Balanced Cleansers:</strong> If desired, choose a mild, pH-balanced cleanser specifically
				formulated for intimate use. Avoid harsh soaps, scented products, douches, or antiseptics,
				as these can disrupt the natural balance of the vagina and lead to irritation or infections.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Front to Back:</strong> Always wipe from the front to the back after using the toilet to prevent
				bacteria from the rectal area from reaching the vagina, which can cause infections.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Pat Dry:</strong> Gently pat the vulva dry with a clean, soft towel. Avoid vigorous rubbing, as it
				can lead to irritation.
			</li>

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Avoiding Intravaginal Cleaning</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			The vagina has a delicate balance of good bacteria and naturally cleanses itself. Intravaginal
			douching or inserting cleaning products into the vagina is unnecessary and can disrupt the
			natural flora, leading to infections or other complications. It's best to allow the vagina to
			maintain its natural cleansing process.

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Proper Menstrual Hygiene</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			During your menstrual cycle, maintaining good hygiene is important. Change tampons, pads, or
			menstrual cups regularly (at least every 4-8 hours) to prevent the buildup of bacteria. Wash
			your hands before and after inserting or removing menstrual products.

		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Opt for breathable, cotton underwear that allows proper air circulation and moisture
			absorption. Avoid tight-fitting clothing or synthetic materials that can trap moisture and
			create an environment for bacterial growth.
