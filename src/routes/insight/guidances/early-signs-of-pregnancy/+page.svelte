		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Discovering that you're pregnant can be an exciting and life-changing moment. However, before
			a missed period, your body may already be sending subtle signs indicating a possible
			pregnancy. In this blog post, we will explore the early signs of pregnancy, helping you
			understand what to look out for and when to consider taking a pregnancy test.

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Missed Period</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			One of the most common early signs of pregnancy is a missed period. However, it's important to
			note that a missed period can also be due to other factors such as stress, hormonal
			imbalances, or certain medical conditions. If you have a regular menstrual cycle and your
			period is late, it might be a good time to consider taking a pregnancy test.

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Breast Changes</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Shortly after conception, hormonal changes can cause noticeable changes in the breasts. You
			may experience increased tenderness, sensitivity, or swelling. The areolas (the area around
			the nipples) may also darken and become more prominent.
		</p>

	<div class="bg-gray-100 rounded p-2 sm:p-4 flex flex-col mt-2 sm:mt-4">
		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Fatigue and Tiredness</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Feeling more tired than usual is a common early pregnancy symptom. The surge in hormones,
			particularly progesterone, can cause fatigue and a general sense of exhaustion. If you find
			yourself needing more rest or napping more frequently, it could be a sign of pregnancy.
		</p>

	<div class="bg-gray-100 rounded p-2 sm:p-4 flex flex-col mt-2 sm:mt-4">
		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Nausea and Morning Sickness</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Nausea and vomiting, often referred to as morning sickness, can occur as early as a few weeks
			after conception. Despite its name, morning sickness can happen at any time of the day. While
			not all pregnant women experience morning sickness, if you find yourself feeling queasy or
			experiencing food aversions, it may be an early indicator of pregnancy.
		</p>

	<div class="bg-gray-100 rounded p-2 sm:p-4 flex flex-col mt-2 sm:mt-4">
		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Frequent Urination</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Increased frequency of urination is another early sign of pregnancy. The growing uterus puts
			pressure on the bladder, leading to more frequent trips to the bathroom. If you find yourself
			needing to urinate more often without any other underlying condition, it could be a clue that
			you're pregnant.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bg-gray-100 rounded p-2 sm:p-4 flex flex-col mt-2 sm:mt-4">
		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Changes in Smell and Taste</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Hormonal changes during pregnancy can heighten your sense of smell and alter your taste
			preferences. Certain smells may suddenly become intolerable, or you may develop cravings for
			specific foods. If you notice a sudden aversion or newfound attraction to certain smells and
			tastes, it could be an early pregnancy symptom.
		</p>

	<div class="bg-gray-100 rounded p-2 sm:p-4 flex flex-col mt-2 sm:mt-4">
		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Mood Swings and Emotional Changes</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Fluctuating hormone levels can also impact your mood and emotions. Some women experience mood
			swings, feeling more emotional or sensitive than usual. If you find yourself experiencing
			unexplained mood changes, it may be worth considering a pregnancy test.
		</p>

	<div class="bg-gray-100 rounded p-2 sm:p-4 flex flex-col mt-2 sm:mt-4">
		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Light Spotting or Implantation Bleeding</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Around 6-12 days after conception, some women may experience light spotting or implantation
			bleeding. This occurs when the fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterine lining. It is
			typically lighter and shorter in duration compared to a regular period. If you notice light
			spotting before your expected period, it might be a sign of early pregnancy.
		</p>

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Conclusion</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Recognizing the early signs of pregnancy can help you understand and embrace the changes
			happening in your body. While these signs can indicate a potential pregnancy, it's important
			to remember that everyone's experience is unique, and not all women will experience the same
			symptoms. If you suspect you might be pregnant, it's recommended to take a home pregnancy test
			or consult a healthcare professional for confirmation. Listen to your body, trust your
			instincts, and embark on this beautiful journey with care and excitement.
