		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Assessing the Risk</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			The first step is to assess the potential risk of pregnancy and STIs. Consider the following
			factors:
		</p>
		<ol class="font-sans text-lg list-decimal list-inside mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			<li>
				<strong>Pregnancy Risk:</strong> If you had unprotected sex during your fertile window (around
				ovulation), the risk of pregnancy is higher. Understanding your menstrual cycle can help you
				estimate the likelihood of conception.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>STI Risk:</strong> Unprotected sex puts you at risk of contracting STIs. If you or your
				partner's STI status is unknown, it is essential to consider the potential for exposure.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Emergency Contraception</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			If you are concerned about the risk of pregnancy, emergency contraception (also known as the
			"morning-after pill") can help prevent pregnancy if taken promptly. Here are key points to
			remember:
		</p>
		<ol class="font-sans text-lg list-decimal list-inside mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			<li>
				<strong>Types of Emergency Contraception:</strong> There are two main types: dedicated emergency
				contraception pills (such as levonorgestrel or ulipristal acetate) and certain regular birth
				control pills taken in specific doses. Copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) can also be used as
				emergency contraception.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Time Sensitivity:</strong> Emergency contraception is most effective when taken as soon
				as possible after unprotected sex, ideally within 72 hours (or up to 120 hours for certain types).
				The sooner you take it, the higher the chances of preventing pregnancy.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Accessing Emergency Contraception:</strong> Emergency contraception is available over-the-counter
				at pharmacies or through a healthcare provider's prescription. Familiarize yourself with local
				regulations and options in your area.
			</li>

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">STI Testing</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Getting tested for STIs is crucial for protecting your sexual health. Consider the following:
		</p>
		<ol class="font-sans text-lg list-decimal list-inside mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			<li>
				<strong>Timing:</strong> Some STIs may not immediately show up on tests, so it's important to
				get tested at the appropriate time. Consult a healthcare professional to determine the ideal
				testing window for different infections.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Testing Options:</strong> There are various STI testing methods available, including
				blood tests, urine tests, swabs, and self-testing kits. A healthcare professional can guide you
				on the most suitable option based on your circumstances.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Confidentiality and Support:</strong> Many healthcare providers offer confidential STI
				testing services, and they can provide counseling and support throughout the process.
			</li>
		</ol>

	<div class="bg-gray-100 rounded p-2 sm:p-4 flex flex-col mt-2 sm:mt-4">
		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Communication and Support</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			After unprotected sex, open communication with your partner is essential. Discuss your
			concerns, feelings, and decisions regarding pregnancy prevention and STI testing.
			Additionally, reach out to friends, family, or support networks for emotional support and
			guidance.

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Future Prevention</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Taking steps to prevent future instances of unprotected sex is vital for long-term sexual
			health. Consider the following strategies:
		</p>
		<ol class="font-sans text-lg list-decimal list-inside mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			<li>
				<strong>Regular Contraception:</strong> Explore different contraceptive methods and choose one
				that suits your lifestyle and preferences. Consult a healthcare professional for guidance on
				selecting the most appropriate method for you.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Dual Protection:</strong> Using both hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills
				or implants) and barrier methods (such as condoms) can offer increased protection against both
				pregnancy and STIs.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>STI Prevention:</strong> Practicing safe sex by using condoms consistently and correctly
				can significantly reduce the risk of contracting STIs. Regular STI testing and open communication
				with sexual partners are also important.

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Conclusion</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Taking immediate action after unprotected sex is crucial for safeguarding your sexual health.
			Assess the potential risk, consider emergency contraception options if pregnancy prevention is
			a concern, and prioritize STI testing. Open communication with your partner and seeking
			support from healthcare professionals and support networks can provide guidance and
