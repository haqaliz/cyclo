		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">The Menstrual Cycle Overview:</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Before delving into the connection between sex and your cycle, let's briefly review the
			menstrual cycle's key phases:
		</p>
		<ol class="font-sans text-lg list-decimal list-inside mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			<li>
				<strong>Menstruation (Days 1-5):</strong> This phase marks the shedding of the uterine lining,
				typically accompanied by bleeding.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):</strong> Hormone levels start to rise, stimulating the
				growth of follicles in the ovaries. Estrogen levels increase, leading to increased energy and
				libido.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Ovulation (Around Day 14):</strong> The mature follicle releases an egg, making this
				a fertile time for conception. Many individuals experience heightened sexual desire during this
				phase.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):</strong> If fertilization doesn't occur, estrogen and progesterone
				levels rise and then fall. This phase may bring fluctuations in mood and libido.
			</li>
		</ol>

					<li>
						<strong>More Energy:</strong> You might feel more energetic and motivated to engage in sexual
						activities.

						<strong>Heightened Sensitivity:</strong> Increased blood flow to the pelvic area can enhance
						sensitivity and pleasure.

						<strong>Self-Care:</strong> Use this time to focus on self-care and maintain open communication
