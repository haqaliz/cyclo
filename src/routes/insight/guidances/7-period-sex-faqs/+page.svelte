		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Is Period Sex Safe?</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			Yes, period sex is generally safe. Menstrual blood is not harmful, and having sex during your
			period doesn't increase the risk of infections or diseases. However, if you or your partner
			have any concerns about STIs (sexually transmitted infections), it's essential to use
			protection and maintain good hygiene.

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">Can I Get Pregnant During Period Sex?</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			While the chances of getting pregnant during your period are relatively low, it's not
			impossible. Sperm can survive in the body for several days, so if you have a shorter menstrual
			cycle or irregular periods, there's a slight risk of pregnancy. To be safe, always use
			contraception if you're not trying to conceive.
