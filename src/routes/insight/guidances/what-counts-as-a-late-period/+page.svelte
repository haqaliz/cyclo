		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			The average menstrual cycle is approximately 28 days, although cycles can vary from person to
			person. A regular menstrual cycle typically falls within a range of 21 to 35 days. Your
			menstrual cycle begins on the first day of your period and ends on the day before your next
			period starts.

		<h3 class="font-sans font-semibold text-3xl">What Counts as a Late Period?</h3>
		<p class="font-sans text-lg text-justify mt-2 sm:mt-4">
			A late period is defined as a delay of more than seven days beyond your expected or typical
			menstrual cycle. In essence, if your period consistently arrives within a certain timeframe,
			and it is delayed beyond this window, it is considered late.
